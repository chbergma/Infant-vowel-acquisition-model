Extract frequency and acoustic similarity information from infant- and adult-directed speech.

To run the example for extracting frequency counts I sent around:
- make sure you have python2.7 installed
- install bidict from pypi (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bidict/0.1.1) if you haven't already
- set up your file paths as outlined in CORPUS_FILE_STRUCTURE_LAYOUT
- run frequency_extractor.py script in /src directory
